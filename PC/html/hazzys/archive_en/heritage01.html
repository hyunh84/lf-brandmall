								HAZZYS has a style and a principle which it has been keeping for a long time across time and space.
								It has been spreading its own flexible world well-suited for the lifestyle of the contemporary men
								who now live in an urban environment as well as that of British high society where the classic styles originate from.
								The classic sentiment and style of Britain became modernized as they combined with preppy style in the early 20th century.
								Once the modern twist styles and reinterpretation of HAZZYS were added, a unique style and principle of HAZZYS
								were finally born as a British Traditional Casual style.

									<div class="desc-txt">
										Preppy look is a modern and casual fashion style based on the Ivy Style which was influenced by the lifestyle and fashion style enjoyed by British High Society.
										College students in both Britain and the U.S. entertained themselves in various sports including rowing, tennis, sailing, polo, cricket, and
										golf varying depending on the academic traditions established in each college. During the process of developing a suitable fashion style for each sport,
										preppy look started to expand its boundary immensely across all lifestyles ranging from business, casual, and sports. 
										On the outside, preppy look may seem like a simple and tidy style but looking deeper into reveals many stories. Preppy look is much more than just simple clothes,
										it is a lifestyle.  Eric Seal, the writer of &lt;Love Story&gt; defined Preppy as a ‘Person who naturally adorns himself in perfect outfits and
										someone who can spontaneously do everything flawlessly.”
										HAZZYS style embodies a suggestion of forming a lifelong friendship with the wearer as well as the Segal’s definition of Preppy lifestyle.

										Even the generations change and trends pass, the classic style keep its value throughout the time and has the principle and

										the spirit of each age always has the grace, comfort, and practicality. HAZZYS style lasts regardless of trends and offers an experience in
										which you can make a harmonious mix-and-match style using other clothes you have.
										The value HAZZYS seeks after is to suggest items that you keep in your closet for the longest time and you wear the most.

							<div class="desc-txt">
								A comfortable clothing based on classic style is referred to as traditional casual style and HAZZYS seeks to modernize and sophisticate this traditional casual style.<br />
								The classics of HAZZYS embodies a natural line which reflects how the British suit, the root of modern suit, follows the movement of bodies.<br />
								It also manifests the original form of British casual which includes activity and functionality possessed by sports uniforms worn during sports enjoyed by British royal families and<br />
								the nobility such as rowing, hunting, polo, or golf. Pique shirts which allowed short-sleeved shirts without the need of jackets, ties, or<br />
								other outers; dynamic pattern play originating from Scottish tartan check; and stripes born from the culture where people enjoyed waves and<br />
								rowing are all representative heritage of HAZZYS which it reinterpreted using modern sentiment. Based on classic,<br />
								HAZZYS pursues sustainable novelty that retains long-lasting universality throughout generations, elegance, and refined principles.
